A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Indeed, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn-out.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card.
And that's not all.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States allow fishing or hunting club members, who vote more Republican, to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party.
What is more, in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of voters in the State.
The same applied to Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early.
On the other hand, 76% of voters were white but these represented only 46% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn-out.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results, which involve unnecessary medical interventions.
Enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests.
Take the test or not?
We asked two specialists for their opinion.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it is between 30 and 40% more likely for metastases to occur in the absence of screening.
I therefore recommend the test from age 50, or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening, and opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening.
Active monitoring will be suggested, and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more, specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated.
Therefore I recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it.
In collaboration with the Société internationale d'urologie [SIU], Movember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no more people smoked, this rate would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that roughly 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Some are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for a number of others.
This massively damages people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec" deplores spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer" it is also said.
Diet
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, it increases the risks of developing colo-rectal cancer.
Likewise, so do cured meat products, and these should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer" it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
For the time being however their research is inconclusive.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson revealed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, no less.
Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle, and greatly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure.
But let's suppose that it really is the Higgs, since the chances of being mistaken seem slim, and see what it is.
In our world, there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll go mad.
However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner we have good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
While lurking in the other are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way): mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles" by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all such exotic bugs as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this article, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, rather like a pebble thrown in a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons.
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for the boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energy levels, rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface.
Which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a 27km circumference! - is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact not all particles, or all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a fridge.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not.
Now, what is it that all this research "can bring"? asks Ms Plamondon.
For science, it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM.
A number of people, moreover, fervently hope that some will be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug certain holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).
But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there won't be any.
Remember: in the very early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work.
They had an inkling of the scientific applications, but nothing as to the rest.
In fact, the late Willard Boyle - a physicist who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget."
Just imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although this was not at all the original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide, and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009.
This does not of course mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, actually, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, in this vital area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir attempted to look more closely.
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The festering prostate cancer had allowed him a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I've made it to seven," he says, with mixed emotions, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can never be prepared for it" he adds.
The disease is doing its work: huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetising lunch, he consents to being helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to the strangers bustling around him, bringing him his medication, offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"What I want most is to be cured of my diarrhoea, it's humiliating" he confided.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this illness.
"During our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Regressing to the stage of a child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the very heart of such regression.
Patients at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocating."
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have fine children" she adds.
"I don't wish for anything more in life" she says, before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe.
She looks forward nevertheless, in the next few days, to a last visit by her son coming from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding.
This is palliative care, given when there is nothing else that can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are palliative care beds for 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether at a physical comfort, emotional or spiritual level.
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or Pepsi, whatever is their tipple.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, a beer was served to Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients" says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, one day follows another but no two are alike.
Along with a 93-year-old man who is savouring his last meeting with his family, sitting firmly wedged in his pillows while toasts are drunk in his honour, a 36-year-young man is dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old" says a concerned Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospital.
Lack of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life, be it at home, in hospital or in a care home.
And a number of organisations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients.
It is precisely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of palliative care physicians fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without anything being done to ease her suffering.
I'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don't receive adequate care.
And at the same time, some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gruelling chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me she regretted that I had given up fighting, she said.
However, she had told me I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients asking to die thank care-givers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians then often resort to palliative sedation, which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering.
Increasingly, an unrelieved patient will have the option of having such palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanise me," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research institutes.
Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
Day after day highway officials, building contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable "system," combining the building industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and organised crime.
An "industry" which has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how the system is crumbling since we took drastic measures" says Jacques Duchesneau ironically, a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, in an in-depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had consented only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, under-the-table financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the inquiry opened in 2010, he says, the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts," with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors" he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "revealing the schemes behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also coupled with its army of government analysts, investigators, and auditors.
Plus the "Marteau squad" policemen who, since 2009, have apparently led the Montreal "sewer cartel" to soft pedal on the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is apparently Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts "system" to the commission.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
Mr Zambito has handed money out freely in the 2000s, giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (roughly 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy-Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts with inflated costs
In Montreal, the corruption "system" ran smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, described it in detail in front of the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts of which he inflated the costs.
Other highway officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices by 30 to 40%, and by false add-ons.
Then an organiser of the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the East of the island, she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold for... 1.6 million to developers, at the height of the real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented, she says she "is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infiltrated by ants - works, to put a stop to the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
The wound is being cleaned, but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring, to avoid the return of these questionable practices.
How to clean house.
Properly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is especially concerned about the role of "elected people aware of the scheme," when they were not up to their necks in the scam!
Estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he says dryly: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but this will not change the situation, he says: "Until election expenses are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding: "We can't go any lower; getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
Although this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new stature with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Some great players have arrived.
Every day I'm making progress alongside them.
The technical staff has also brought me a lot.
Day by day, all these things help me raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything moves very fast in football.
But I don't get worked up.
From my debut at the Clairefontaine INF pre-training centre to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved step by step.
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing matches at a high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot as regards my position.
He's supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
Definitely.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all the experts.
Today he has no equal in Ligue 1, and he's one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has masses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he will bring more titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging discussion with him.
I was just coming back from a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon overtook us at the top.
But we're waiting on the sidelines.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the last 16 in the right way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we'll have something to say against some very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish top in our pool, ahead of Porto, to have home advantage in the last 16 match.
Can PSG become a top European club in the short term?
It already has the budget...
To become a top European club, Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time.
Today, this isn't the case.
Financially, PSG has the means to make it happen.
In Ligue 1, would not winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
Definitely, it would be a major disappointment.
This year, we're really committed to winning the championship.
We weren't far away last season.
In May, there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first.
It was a terrific season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, 79 points is good enough to be top...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
I think this is the year.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much of PSG?
It's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and they still found things to blame us for, that's definitely a bit frustrating.
You wonder what more people expect.
You're never going to win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
It takes time to build a team.
The Champions League proved we could hold our own.
Look at Manchester City who, for two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last 16, despite also having spent huge amounts!
Based on the amounts invested, you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break!
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were no good last season, were "boosted" by the new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that, despite all the difficulties, we finally did it.
PSG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much so that people say there is a "Zlatan dependence."
This means Ibrahimovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came, and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1.
He's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
And also he respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also helps everyone else progress.
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team?
A disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting any game time.
I saw some things there and came out stronger.
Today, I'm playing well in selection matches.
Which is what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
I've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour.
What do think about Didier Deschamps's first few months in charge of the Blues?
He has the results he wanted.
We're well placed in the World qualifying group.
The coach is tough, close to the players, and inspires them to win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make any comparisons.
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the Blues to Brazil.
Did the good draw (1-1) snatched in Spain, on 16 October, represent a founding match?
That match gave us confidence.
Everybody fought for everybody.
Before that shock in Spain, I'd never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network.
Close to a thousand web sites accept bitcoins as donations or means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, returning today to around a dozen dollars (rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as 'credits', used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, on each occasion, a central authority controls and handles the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does the network operate?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
So the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts, broadcast across the entire network.
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers, and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, then "hash" it all up.
The goal being to find the number that gives a special imprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any modification would alter the imprint.
If a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints.
The computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible down to the hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
"The loophole used is not the protocol itself" says Pierre Noizat reassuringly, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
But cash also has this weakness.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge sell-offs" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged" welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment by mobile, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
Also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement by merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognise" says Pierre Noizat, who confirms he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to reappraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to become firmly established, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, says it will reassess the various risks, currently regarded as high, in the event of the currency's success.
We got out of Afghanistan.
What now?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future, without expecting us to do everything.
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former leaders in refuge in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces, like in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, both ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted, by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be so when Westerners become more scarce.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with French funding, was carried out in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country being torn apart by the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghanis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahidin, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main anti-Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001.
They became profiteers, seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts.
They have become discredited; what is more, most of them did not fight themselves.
The people, as I heard in the countryside, want a Government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who were able to benefit from American largesse will leave: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
Roughly 65% of the population is less than 25; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In towns and cities, the state schools are full, with girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All of them, including the armed opponents, are partial to mobile phones; television, with its Turkish soap operas that show a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, land of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation, in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised State, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014.
But, since the 50s and already well before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid.
No industries have been re-established, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, apart from fruit and vegetables.
The Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' high school, boys' high school, French Department at the University, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" service from the Ministry of defence (Cimic), closed in 2012, has carried out, and continues to carry out successfully, through a small French NGO, many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages.
These projects, involving large numbers of local labour, have helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kapisa province.
To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is what farmers told me they want, a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour, well controlled and directly affecting them.
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gamble for President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he has decided to go for broke.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text, amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country.
According to his opponents, the President is persevering in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "go back on his word" and 'trample the law."
His supporters affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, by speeding up the transition process.
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks.
A very short period, which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favourably, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Particularly since a hasty vote smacks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers," these powers supposedly expiring following adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling they had failed to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise.
In order to obtain a quorum, 11 members, alternates, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles were for the most part voted unanimously.
Commentators were also amused that one of the only diversions of the day was expressed with regard to... the hour of prayer, some Committee members feeling that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday evening, has 234 articles.
The main focus of attention, article 2, remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, were hoping to replace "the principles" by "the rules," which would have allowed stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" respond the liberals, who see only a communication coup.
Because in their opinion Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which grants Al-Azhar University an advisory role, with particular reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This suggests the beginnings of a theocracy."
The liberals' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rector of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, things remain under civil rule.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics, some trained in the French system" qualifies Alexis Blouet, who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Editor's note].
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribunals, as requested by associations for the defence of human rights.
Who also voice their concerns about the text, which they consider repressive.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places await Ukrainian tourists, the omphalos and a sea of saline water
The Holy Land combines the splendour of biblical truths, modern comfort and primeval nature.
AiF [Argumenti i Fakti] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel.
Let's worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It is considered that all who enter this baptism "bath" are blessed by God.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his magic: turned water into wine at a wedding, walked on water, calmed a storm, and filled the nets.
This is also where Jesus came before his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk through the Way of Grief or Via Dolorosa.
It starts by the Antonia Fortress - Praetorium - where the judgement took place, and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, Stone of Unction and the place of Jesus' burial.
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian omphalos, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected at the site that, according to Christian legend, yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the Wailing Wall, which remained from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Travel along a vertical
Ruins of the Massada Fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies, built by Herod in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on cliffs in the mountains at an elevation of 450 m above sea level.
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing.
Others are delivered to this historical mountaintop by a cableway.
In the north of the country, at an elevation of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort called Hermon, which fills up with tourists in winter months.
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of ski pistes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods used to live on the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has about 300 museums.
You won't be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit.
Among them - Museum of Israel, located close to Knesset (Parliament).
It has ancient Qumran manuscripts and Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Judean desert, along with about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artefacts.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also interesting.
Its exhibits include a wide range of impressionists and expressionists like Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Sisley, Cezanne, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the bath museum Al-Basha, which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath attendants of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or gift shops.
Entry is free of charge, and contributions are strictly not allowed.
The fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel-Aviv, which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history.
The most tragic section is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in and find yourself in complete darkness.
Stars are glimmering,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
Wellness
There are three resort areas in Israel, located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Seas.
Each have swimming pools, aqua parks, dolphinaria and oceanaria.
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months, because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people swim in it all year round.
Incidentally, it is the most unusual sea in the world, located in the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
Its azure water is saline and easily keeps you afloat, even if you don't know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are surreal in their beauty.
People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wraps and medicinal muds, and to improve their health if they have dermatitis, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, or diabetes, or to return emotional balance.
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old section of Tel-Aviv - in the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia runs through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legends, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists really like to wander the narrow streets named after signs of the zodiac.
They say, if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, fortune will come to you.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can walk around a Roman theatre, "capture" the Crusader fortress.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prefects, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A note for the tourist
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: approximately 30% of the country's population speaks Russian.
For the trip, it is better to take dollars, not euros, because they are easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1 dollar = 3.8 shekels).
City transportation is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower.
In essence, it is an underground cable railway.
A ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 shekels, and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers.
According to the Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated in Israel.
Between Friday evening and the sunset on Saturday, markets, stores, and public transportation stop working.
The work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels have only kosher food, with no pork, seafood, fish with no scales, or dishes that combine milk with meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked using coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, falafel (balls made of ground chickpeas), fruits and vegetables.
The streets of Israel don't have homeless dogs.
But there are many well-fed cats, which walk around lazily.
In the evening, they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of parked cars.
These pussycats like busy places and do not refuse treats.
Car rental, depending on car type, costs from 37 (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) dollars a day.
Plus insurance of 15 dollars a day.
Bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Museum entrance costs 30 shekels on average.
In numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Visitors and holidaymakers arrive mostly from the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
Between January and October 2012 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land, which is 51% more than a similar figure in 2010, before the removal of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
Only the "high and mighty" make it to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing, the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Mostly these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home.
A new law came into effect on December 1, which obliges every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
For the moment, this law applies only to those who intend to work in services, housing and utility services, household services, and retail.
But with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-residents.
In addition to language, Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested.
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit.
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language.
People who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also exempt under the law.
Purpose, doomed fate, and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, Moscow State University (MGU), St. Petersburg State University (SPbGU), and other Russian education institutions.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have been opened.
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services.
But human rights activists, asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force: what will it actually achieve?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-residents?
First of all, according to representatives of the migration service, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery.
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants, explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia, Viktor Sebelev.
Rights protection should begin before their departure.
Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without profession, education, who do not know Russian, who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems.
If a migrant does not understand the language, says Sebelev with certainty, he is doomed to come across unconscientious people, who, pretending to help, will force upon him a "ticket" to terrible, cramped barracks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents, slaving away 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing at home, but when they arrive, they are lied to, their passports are taken, they are not paid what they were promised," confirms the Head of the Main Migrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Not be angry, boss!
Nonetheless, many citizens of Central Asian countries, who plan to go to work in Russia, admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good, but they can barely write in their own language.
Naturally, this is not so much their fault, but due to poverty: very few Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford even a basic education.
Their families don't even have food to feed their children, not to mention decent clothing, shoes, and supplies.
After reaching adolescence, these kids go to work at the first opportunity.
It is hard, if language knowledge is bad, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If they have no status, there will be no testing, nor any official work in the future.
In the meantime, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No Unauthorized Entry"
Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles.
Whereas a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand.
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers, without registration, hence the extortion.
"They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared with journalists.
"Roll up, don't be cheap, get your artwork"
On the first day of the law's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake.
A few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already.
Forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer.
Naturally, they were not free for their owners: each of the migrants, who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them.
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing, which costs three thousand.
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates could not just be bought.
For the moment, the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course.
In addition, those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to toughen up the law for owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents: CLICK shots at weddings, where there were no casualties, and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, resulting in CLICK the death of seven people.
Policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared online, whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless toughening."
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal, said criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov to BBC Russia.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012, whereas 1,168,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period.
Authors of the open letter are certain that the toughening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market.
According to them, one can find any weapon at a low price right now.
Nonetheless, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" market of weapons is replenished through several channels.
There are five such channels, explains retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons.
First: "army or military loot," i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians," says Baranets.
Next are "black weapons," stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies.
Baranets explains that this covers weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies' employees.
Illegal arms are taken to be sold from military warehouses.
Explosions have often been heard at military warehouses.
"There are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional, in order to cover the shortage," says the former military man.
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution, according to Baranets.
"There are so many private weapons factories now, which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market, including in Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is trafficking.
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There's production there, sometimes handmade; and a mafia has formed, which has organized a stream," explains the former military man.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analysis and Public Management Planning in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Rosstat, criminology literature and open data from portals on weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, comes from the military and security forces.
Half of all arms on the black market are there "because of officials, whose work is connected with weapons," states the report.
According to researchers' data, 17% of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas, 14% is theft during production, 5% is "black archaeology."
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores, who wished to remain anonymous, asserts that the weapons found by "black" diggers are not being bought any more, because they're too old.
According to him, dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods.
One piece, for example a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer.
It is issued to him, and given through the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that police are aware of everything, that is why periodically, when the crime detection rate is low, it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants," says the consultant.
"Like in a luxury store"
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends.
I looked at sites, blogs, till someone responded, offering me to go to Begovaya station, where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the "corner" so we can negotiate.
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military commentator Viktor Baranets
To get a weapon, I need someone with connections, says the sales consultant. - I have an acquaintance, but I'm not sure it's reliable.
There are salesmen on labour markets, but one needs to "come" there conditionally "from John Doe, who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth."
Right now, even if I need a few knuckledusters, I get them through someone I trust.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I won't give him away.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990's, when he was preparing to publish an article about this.
The formulas are still the same, according to him.
He was given an album of pictures with "anything and everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," he recalls.
According to Baranets, the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything.
I, the potential client, am not just buying; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am certain that the weapon is good, we begin to negotiate," describes the expert.
Store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and "Vkontakte" groups, where weapons "for different purposes" are on offer.
No documents or personal meetings are needed.
"It's enough to have a certain sum of money," says the advertisement heading on the website "Buy a pistol or rifle."
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
Can a minor buy?
"Without a license, of course," asks user "John" (name is changed).
"Want to buy a TT, Moscow," concisely requests "Fedorenkov."
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons.
People come like hungry fish to bait, and then mine coal in Siberia.

I heard about this: normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws of Russia.
People accept orders.
The buyer pays at an ATM.
"In response, a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says Press Secretary of the Rights to Weapons non-governmental organization Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail.

Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms, 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the Rights to Weapons organization, a Makarov gun can be acquired for 100-300 dollars.
The wait time is a month to a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the mid-level management of these warehouses.
According to official statistics of the authorities, the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7% as compared to January-October 2011, amounting to 22,900, while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.8%.
Fast-food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.S.A.
Up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonald's at one time or another
In the last few days, there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S.A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Walmart chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Right now, nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out early.
Actions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations.
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains, the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them.
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet.
46 cents a year?
Actions began last week after Thanksgiving, on Black Friday, when massive sales drew millions of people in America, sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low-to-medium incomes.
Walmart sells everything imaginable, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
So many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace.
Availability and assortment made Walmart one of the biggest American corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees.
These latter also complain about hard work conditions, for example lack of lift trucks and hand-held scanners.
Protesters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee, receiving 9.5 dollars/hour, cannot afford this.
Scientists from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars/hour, it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries right now.
If Walmart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In one year, they will only spend 12.39 dollars more than now.
Walmart supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day, and during the period Walmart sold about 5000 products a second.
In total, its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, asserted in an interview with a left-wing site, the Huffington Post, that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees left the workplace, and the protest act was just "another PR trick" of the union that organized it.
"Free cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they're not so welcome in the progressive city, that is why they don't exist here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7.25 dollars an hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it with time, but very little. On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.90 dollars/hour.
Nobody earns less in this expensive city.
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money.
Once upon a time, almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald's, working part-time after school, living with parents.
Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long.
Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them.
Participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald's on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars/hour, i.e. more than double their present wages.
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nagging or firing.
On the other hand, the administration does not often ease their life.
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union.
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees.
Disagreeing
Noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald's by Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke out. One of them, Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's claims it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!"
Demonstrators were supported by other prominent NY democrats, like Bill de Blasio, a candidate for NY city mayor, who said: "We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees, so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing, which every New Yorker deserves!."
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and many of them were not fast food employees, which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement.
"At the moment, the mind cannot be deceived too well"
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality, lately seen primarily through the prism of special glasses.
At first, a functional model was shown by Google in the summer, at its annual conference. Then, in November, it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too.
However, according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, Shahram Izadi, glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company.
They are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us, in simple terms, about the work your research group does.
- We work on the interaction of people with machines, at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
While people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them.
We want to look 5-10 years into the future and predict cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward. Almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everyone likes control by gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect shifted the interaction to the physical level, much still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has improved (the system receives more data), but output still needs to get better.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
But for this, we need to identify both the user and the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
Above all, get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but is it overestimated?
- It clearly cannot be called a cure-for-all - there's a question of privacy, because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions.
In reality, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own niche.
For example, we had a project to control devices in public places, in which we thought about movements, not wide movements, but small, reserved ones.
Movements were not recorded by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles.
It's big right now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch.
In general, the future lies in the mixed control, e.g. movement + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water?
You will talk and show at the same time.
- Usually I just say.
- Oh, that will be very hard to detect.
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approximation.
I think in the near future, we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person's reaction.
This could be, e.g. laser sensors. They have a decent depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something else?
- In general, the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k/s speed.
It's not just the mega pixels, though, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
So it's important to remember about the resolution on the X, Y, but also the Z axis.
Speed, the number of images per second, is also very important.
Human movements are relatively dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms, while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine.
In my work, it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second.
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased?
- In Kinect there are three cameras now, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second one, the recipient of the signal.
The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range.
It is not applied to determine the object's depth.
Potentially, a large number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse, by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect, play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three-dimensional determination of the position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Don't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies?
- Certainly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time, but I think that the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, where you could shift from glasses to smart phone, projection display, and everywhere else based on a cloud platform.
Glasses are a very personal device, that is their strength (private things are seen only by you) and, at the same time, their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Ironman, but to a regular person.
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tactile sensations.
For now, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image.
It is great at registering pushes!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these "images in the air" a sense of tangibility, for example, the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation, but very weak right now, as if someone blew on your fingertip.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in fingers, which is also a promising area.
- Have you tried to deceive the mind?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something?
- This is a good idea and we haven't tried this yet.
It conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person, who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open, almost limitless space; we are working on the concept of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and giant balloons.
So far deceiving the mind has had limited success, there's work for many years to come.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings.
Judgement calls instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project St. Petersburg Avant-garde, dedicated to residents who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city, often recognized in Europe, bypassing fame in Russia.
The new player in Rosbalt - the bold artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed all in red, who can be seen by the Russian Museum, or by the Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and shows.
Kirill Miller's work always brings in crowds of people, no matter where they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's early 90's.
Moreover, he is a city man, who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone's spirit.
Recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg's music man, because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city all in red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, image-maker and society.
Although in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad kind.
But my provocations are aimed at starting conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realise that you must be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky House of Culture, where my work was displayed.
It became clear to me that this is my path.
Then, the wave of older free, unofficial artists was gone, while new, free artists like me were not understood.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with post-Gaza-Nevsky style artists ("post-gazonevschina"), which led to Pushkinskaya-10, and the wave was no longer.
I'm drawn to theatre, clothing, music, all genres except for literature.
- And all this has been united in your Art-clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should come together.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and while the renovation work had not started, there was a musical and creative club, a Bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: NOMy, Tequila Jazz, I remember when Shnur was brought there with the Van Gogh's Ear project.
Shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs, wearing tight leotards, and the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin was with them.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg was the presenter of many programs before Hali-Gali times.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and a great career was on its way, but the basic education and mentoring he received from us.
Gallery D 137, Griboyedov club - all these echo the Art-clinic.
That is where our staff and regular customers left for.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press, for the People of Our City prize.
I was nominated Artist of the Year, my climax came to an end.
In the new times, it is uncomfortable to work by old rules. I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different. You can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is marked by a recognizable style.
- Many of my works are hits, with clearly reflected relevance and acuity.
I will have a programme exhibit, "Russian museum in clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I was social before, now it is painful and scary to be like that.
But everything is blurred in clowns, tragedy is removed.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian changing of clothes by order.
Nowadays, people are judged by appearance, not their inner qualities.
Who knows, maybe you cannot shake his hand, and need to spit in his face.
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes.
- Recently we saw you in the role of music man. - A cultural city should have such a character.
Who fits the role better than I?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art should be neat, considerate, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
People used to get together in flocks, Bohemians liked one thing, the simple people, something else.
Now, everybody is divided into micro societies, it's hard to be liked by everyone.
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all.
Now you have to think who you will please.
Now, each cult hero has 100 fans.
- But several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov!
- The cast-outs go to see him, the sexual-social sphere is at work there.
But 300 people will come for culture, not 10,000. In the end, there's less management, money, everything dies out.
I have fans; the main thing is not to betray them, not to spoil what I have earned.
In my youth, I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the same wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end with.
Concepts are often mixed up these days.
People say: spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumerism, it's "from another opera."
I am a man of yesterday's culture. I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting.
This is the culture I'm for.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an official for culture.
But not everyone can be engaged in culture.
Under the right rulers everything was different. Kings may not have understood culture very well, but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
Here in St. Petersburg, there are people who could be experts, but they are pushed to the side, because more advanced experts are needed, who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them.
Judgement calls are what thrive now.
Even Erart, but they're different because they say honestly that we don't accept all modern art. There are some artists, who need to find other museums for themselves.
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has much more culture, there is bedrock there.
It's hard for art to grow on our rocks.
We need cultural bedrock, but we now have more writers than readers. This is wrong.
In Europe, there are many curious people, who go to art exhibits, concerts.
Here, this layer is thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was in the beginning of last century.
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant.
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or an encounter with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet?
I think the choice is small.
There are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothetically.
"Venus and Mars," says Senior Researcher of the P.K. Shternberg State Astronomy Institute (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin.
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life, Venus has 500-degree temperatures.
Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
The question of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were run on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts.
Then, insects were bred in orbit, small fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space, to check how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get an absolutely normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is related to the fact that this chick needs to find support, needs to get on its feet and start moving," explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
Having found no support, chicks were tumbling around in disorder.
After 10 hours, the newborns experienced complete atrophy of instincts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
And the problem was that they simply died after four days.
"We bred chicks twice there, and then stopped, because it is impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, confirming the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "mini-ark" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex beings will be on the Bion bio-satellite.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space with foetus.
In principle, there was nothing extraordinary there.
"This was on bio-satellites, but again, it was a singular experiment and such research needs to be conducted," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had babies.
But it's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct, when they're out of their familiar environment.
In principle, people, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking, and are able to create a fitting emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body.
Our "Seagull" left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space.
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight.
"Nobody answered this question," says rocket and space industry veteran, Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after flying to space, the first woman in space Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, very few cosmonauts, who were OK and had healthy children after long flights.
"What's more, it is dangerous even for orbital flights," adds pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the USSR, Hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
And yet, humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
Hydro-laboratory of CPK - mandatory phase of training for a flight.
Here, cosmonauts practice skills of working in open space in zero-gravity conditions.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water is a foreign medium, although comfortable, for infants it is a native element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean.
There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in the womb; it is easier to get used to water after that.
In principle, it is logical, because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing.
"This is very little time to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In other words, if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural, a woman needs gravity, earth's pull.
Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced.
Well, let's assume that childbirth stimulators will work out.
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room.
"Then what?" - asks Valery Poliakov about this non-trivial issue.
On the other hand, a baby also needs artificial gravity.
When a body does not feel the earth's pull, it does not form the skeletal and muscular system.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training, as they do with adults.
He will simply not have what he needs to survive.
"And this experiment, that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to us bringing a handicapped, completely unadapted human to earth," predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
For the moment, birth of children in space is just a theory.
However, with time, it will become reality, when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, who were born in space.
NKU Head: Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts, but it lags behind in their application.
This was said by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktualne.cz.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors.
As an example of improper practice, they cite Petr Necas's approach to the so-called "Svarc System."
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed?
"The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce," asserts Kala.
At the audit committee's session in the House of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared.
What exactly was this about?
This is about parallel auditing, which we began around two years ago.
Simply put, this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts, followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself.
We brought all this together, and although the audit is not yet complete, some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation might be even "more concise and complete," however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany.
This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough, and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws.
What does this project actually help you with, and what do you think its outcome will bring?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided.
However, just because we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be procured.
The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork, and those, who wish to look for loopholes in it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher.
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts.
How does the audit system work in Germany?
Is there an office like the NKU, or is it organised differently?
As far as the office is concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof functions like our NKU, and it is organised like ours, it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently, but basically both offices operate similarly.
Powers are also similar to a degree, though of course Germany is organised federally, so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own.
The BRH can only audit federal money, known to us as state funds.
Public funds, which, for us, are administered by regional and municipal authorities, are audited by the federal courts of auditors there.
When it comes to their legislation, is it more straightforward than ours?
Overall, I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data, nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect.
Is this because, perhaps, they have better enforcement?
That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparisons.
It should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary, they encounter a whole range of problems.
If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would they?
Coming back to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt already?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet.
Since we carry out our audits ex-post, a certain delay has to be taken into account.
As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit, or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
Under the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth constraining the law in this way, in that case?
I do not think this is the way.
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalise those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision.
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy.
So how can we get out of this?
Let's see where this dead-end takes us.
The Prime Minister recently said the ODS will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so-called "Svarc System" - what does this mean?
Is the Svarc System prohibited or allowed?
The Law must be set out one way or the other, and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce.
He may say: "Let us change this law and relax it," but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there.
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected.
On the other hand, it is a tragedy, when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality.
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.
Roads are icy in places, but mostly passable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, the main roads are icy and snowy.
However, the majority of roads are passable, with extra care needed in places.

In the Carlsbad region, the roads have been usable this morning, though in some places they were icy and snowy.
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day.
Snowing in the region has stopped, and only a thin layer of snow remains in the lowlands.
However, the ridges of the Krusne Mountains have around 30 centimetres of snow.
In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist, according to the local highway service.
The R6 high-speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction.
Caution is, of course, appropriate, for example, on certain bridges, where the surface can be icy and slippery.
All secondary and tertiary roads are also passable, including mountain roads.
In certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and compacted snow patches.
Above all, at higher levels, extra care should be taken while driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralove region
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia, there might be a risk of black ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of compacted snow, according to the Road and Motorway Directorate.
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice, which might occur at higher altitudes of the Pardubice region in particular.
Black ice may occur around Lanskroun, Usti nad Orlici, Policky, Svitavy, and Vysoke Myto, and particularly on secondary and tertiary roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads have been chemically treated around Svitavy.
Snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Krkonose and Orlicke mountains.
At higher altitudes, there is a compacted snow layer on the roads around Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia the day will be mostly clear to partly cloudy, and dry.
Temperatures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly, with a light wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region have been usable this morning, with extra care needed in some places. Drivers should take the weather conditions into account.
The morning will be frosty, with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero.
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature, certain roads may be icy.
Drivers should expect mist in places, though visibility will gradually improve.
This information was reported by the region's highway service.
The D5 motorway is drivable almost without restriction, but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80th and 131st kilometre marks.
Most primary road surfaces are dry and frost-free.
Southern areas of the Pilsen and Tachov regions may have icy patches.
Secondary and tertiary roads are wet, and may therefore also have icy patches.
Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc region
Drivers should expect snow slush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Olomouc region.
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cervenohorkse sedlo and on the way to Videlsky Kriz.
Snowploughs were brought out by falling snow overnight, the Sumperk region, according to highway maintenance, got around three centimetres of snow.
In other parts of the region, roads are mainly passable without restrictions.
"In the Sumperk region, traces of snow have remained at the highest altitudes.
Drivers should expect snow slush at Cervenohorske sedlo in the direction of Jesenik," the dispatch officer for the Sumperk highway service told CTK today.
Their Jesenik counterparts also made an outing overnight; the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment, according to them.
The Olomouc region's roads are usable without restriction, while in the area of Sternberk drivers should beware in wooded areas, where roads have remained wet.
Usti nad Labem region, Liberec region
Since this morning, the snowploughs have reported several places, which are difficult to pass in northern Bohemia.
Besides certain snow-covered places, or some icy frost patches, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy. In the lowlands, however, particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands, there are no problems and roads are mostly dry.
No traffic hold-ups have so far been reported.
Icy frost patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Steti.
According to meteorologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day, with a clear night and freezing temperatures.
Adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I/13 road between the Usti nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure of the Telnice to Kninice road was caused by bent tree branches, which were weighed down to road level by snowfall.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month?
It is just another startler, which we like to latch on to.
Together with The Tap Tap band, we tend to joke about it, saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely.
In December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give our readers some details on this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event, which we have been planning for the past two years.
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar, due on the 21st of December at 11:10 a.m.
On the eve, the 20th of December, at 9pm, 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague, Brno, and Ostrava.
They will end at around the time when Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us, reaches the end of the Mayan calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was probably my idea, later we worked all the details out with our designer, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world, we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet, when we, one day, hand it over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also prepared a range of unique items, shoes, t-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz to support our cause.
The Tap Tap band, together with other artists, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World is cancelled."
It is already well received on YouTube, will it figure at the fund-raising concerts?
Of course, for the grand finale, as long as the world does not end beforehand.
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time.
The anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by Tomas Hanak, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you end up working with them?
We collaborate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to organising a lot of fund-raising events and concerts...
We try to really get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
Equipping the wheelchair-accessible educational Studeo centre, which is already in its sixth year, in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jedlicka Institute for the disabled.
Tutors come in regularly to spend time with the Jedlicka Institute's students and run activities, which they enjoy and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors, so we try to provide this for them in this way.
Within the construction project at the Jedlicka Institute, a separate building is planned, which we can move into with this project.
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists.
How do you select them?
We have tried to compile a programme, which speaks for all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear.
Further details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any more "bombastic events" in the future?
In May, we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring, so we will definitely be preparing a good line-up with some interesting guests.
Next year, we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your international plans are not modest; you have already performed, for instance, in Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people.
How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation?
It is not as scary as it might seem at first.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs, which must be transported in the luggage area; we must also, of course, carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases...
Nevertheless, we have so far managed it without any problems, CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, so much so that, on occasion, I was quite surprised.
Even in Moscow, which we have just returned from, it all went smoothly.
Thanks to these international trips, you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues, public attitudes to disability and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places, where everything functions better than here, we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is rather inaccessible; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own.
Obvious things, such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts, are not commonplace there.
Fortunately, citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities.
And on the other hand, where do we still lag behind more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, which we still lag behind on...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected.
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public, and they can use the toilets, go to the museum, or wherever...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life, in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead!
Public respect or accessibility is one thing, but it is only when we can become famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers that things will really begin to change.
So far there are only exceptional cases, people who are strong-willed.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let us look back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to form it?
I began my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people, who were interested in doing something.
Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the saxophone - I started a music club with a colleague.
With time, as our moderator Ladya Angelovic says, it has grown a little out of our control (laugh).
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band.
We realised that work, which goes on unseen can be like it never existed.
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights?
From the outset, I felt there was potential to do things a little differently.
Show business is filled with things, where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way; all new things are taken in hesitantly and take a long time.
Things, which are unique, are few and far between, but I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things.
A person's first impression on seeing you is, of course, pity - it is a natural reaction...
But that pity is simply wasted, because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings, who need to be pitied.
They are people, who can fully live life and blossom, assuming, of course, that they have the right environment for it.
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something, it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole.
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader, as many people are suggesting?
If we want to achieve top class work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline.
I think this is to be expected.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly disappears.
That is how it works everywhere, with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members.
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998?
Only one, Ladya Angelovic.
We are an open group, people come and people go, this is unavoidable.
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open.
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9pm.
The venues will be Praha Incheba, Brno Fleda, and Ostrava Plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
All three cities will be joined by a televised link-up at the evening's close for a united rendition of The Tap Tap's anthem "The End of the World is cancelled"
The concert's goal is to raise funds to equip the STUDEO multi-functional wheel-chair accessible learning centre at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission fee to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years of age go free, tickets on sale from Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agency, being the second nation from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a fully fledged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects.
Of course, Poland's path to the space had begun much earlier.
Polish boffins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understanding.
I look back, for instance, to the lecture of A Sternfeld in Warsaw's astronomy observatory, who, on the 6th of December 1933, presented ideas on his pioneering work Entry into space.
The thoughts of the young engineer (born 1905) left his audience cold, and years later Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown an interest in his work.
In 1934, for his work Entry into space, Sternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France.
The above mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals, and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects.
Gadomski became a world-known promoter of astronautics and his contribution was, notably, recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
In 1925, Poland had already built a handcar which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, both the project's designer, and the project's details, are unknown.
It is not even clear, whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar or to slow it down.
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time.
In 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs.
The research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the documents, it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
Of course, the advance of the German army interrupted the research.
In 1937, the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket designed by engineer Rohozinski appeared in the trade press, and in the following year The Rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket-bomb appeared, authored by Leliwy-Krywoblocki.
Both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines.
Immediately prior to the War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that coordinated all the work.
The Board was appointed in 1937, but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War.
Further work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astronautics Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954, in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of astronautics.
In one of these, by Prof. Subotowicz, the establishment of a company is proposed, which would dedicate itself to astronautics.
At the time, there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Company (PTA) sought entry to the International Astronautics Federation (est. 1951) and by autumn the PTA was already a full member.
In the following year, the PTA's first chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astronautics Federation.
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research.
The first RM-1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958.
The rocket, with a ceiling of 1800 metres, measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg.
Later, the improved RM-1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds.
Of course, in 1962 further research was stopped.
The successor to the RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 litres was available, Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three models was 37km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of Meteor-2 was underway in the Aeronautics Institute, with its first launch tests in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg, and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km.
Subsequently built models were the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Poland's admission to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 should be mentioned, as well as the appointment of a national COSPAR board two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
Abolishing the legislation on public works is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works.
The resolution caused lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented financial systems in the EU, just as those in the globalised world, are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition.
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation.
Due to significant labour cost differences (salaries) there is pressure on prices.
On this basis, it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods, "the rug is pulled" from under the competition's prices to capture a greater market share and, in this way, increase its own profits.
On a wider scale, this means most businesses must move production abroad, import cheaply from abroad, or close down. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility, and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes, the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase.
The whole situation is bolstered by the businessman's complete unwillingness to pay taxes, which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data.
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition, aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment.
In other words, governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards.
This occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law.
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital, especially in terms of salaries.
On one hand, this economic system of force, in case of long-term unemployment, on the other, restricted employee rights in the workplace.
This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich.
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out centres for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage.
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag.
The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation, where people are pressured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to eke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society, in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment.
At this point we have to ask where this may come from?
If it is to come from other EU states, then poverty is being shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin.
Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy.
Thereupon, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country, for its own selfish ends.
Here, the answer must be yes.
The proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent, and in all states, omnipresent lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany the situation is such that state ministries, through lack of financial resources, contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms, who are basically connected with industry.
These laws are then approved in the Bundestag.
Real power does not come from the people as the Western-style constitutions claim, but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests.
It is clear that liberally-orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation, as is described by Appian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pompei: "The State was already long in complete degeneration and its offices taken by force.
With bribery, illegal acquisition of benefits, and with stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rife and unhindered, and the people would vote for a result which had been bought" ..."people with principles did not run for office, so on one occasion the whole debacle meant the state went eight months without consuls.." .."There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being autocracy, and an energetic man should be elected." Appian had Pompei in mind, but it was Cesar who changed democracy for autocracy permanently.
The conclusion, just as in antiquity, the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole.
The outcome is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms.
The causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs, when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude, can expect its next cycle.
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity, as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not the answer, at least not in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, internationally as well as within Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population's living standards.
This pattern is thus systemic.
To address this, there are targeted political and social reforms, which strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the people's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," from Sting's Fragile, where one of the main verses from the refrain is "Lest we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be none," said the dying Gutle Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, has sparked a lot of reaction.
Some stand by Israel, arguing it has the right to self-defence, and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, claiming racism by the Israeli state, claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs, and that Israel is a terrorist state.
I do not want to dwell, in these repeated periodic waves of killing, on who is the transgressor and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation, and did not live through the start of the violence.
I would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes, a look at whom, most of all, this 95-year long tension is serving (starting from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on this small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, while others are derived from my own understanding of who, that is, which group of people is the main source of events in modern history.
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people, who had chosen their path independently, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-calculated goal.
We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation's lifespan.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the puppet master (whether someone else stands above them, I am unsure, but I would not rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90's of the 19th century, in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high criminality, which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power, increasing wealth, or both.
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government).
Whoever attempted to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began to issue his own (that is state-issued) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed (Federal Reserve), and was killed in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three-world-war plan by the freemason leader of the 33rd degree, Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially from Great Britain, and the third will reduce the world's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury, and will not use up so many resources), the creation of one universal faith (ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution), and finally the seizing of absolute power.
The method, which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way, employ is the instigation of crises, followed by the offering of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are false, however, and always lead to a worse situation (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated).
Thus, having succeeded in assassinating Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo thereby unleashing World War I, they destroyed tsarist Russia with the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German capitulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled.
To facilitate the inception of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by saddling Germany with huge war reparations, thereby making a radicalist example of the impoverished masses, it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution, while also creating a multi-racial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed did, the role of a fifth colony, once the war had been ignited.
At the end of the 19th Century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which strove to form the Jewish State, seeking out an area of historic Judea, Jerusalem, to make its capital (the Return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the leash, which international bankers were holding him on, or whether his actions were all part of the plan, is difficult to determine, nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world's acceptance of the Jewish State.
Israel was officially formed in 1948, and just as the war reparations for World War II were layed on Germany, the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war's hotbed.
Provided the international bankers succeed, the Jewish Nation, as with the second, will be the victims on the front line, now together with the Arabic - or more generally, Muslim - population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but on an international level (just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the wrong-doer and who is the victim in the Palestine-Israel conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence, while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power?
Here, we must differentiate between Israel's general population and their leaders, because, just as it happens here, the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for.
Israel's current prime minister, Netanyahu 'the hawk', is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to instigate war with Iran, which would, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...) lead to a greater threat of global conflict, and through its control of the Hormuz Strait, where 20% of the world's oil must sail (the channel is only 2 miles wide), to the destruction of the world's economy.
In what light stand the words, spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order."
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world, where each new-born is implanted with a chip, which makes their existence completely subjugated.
"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast,
for it is man's number. His number is six hundred and sixty six."
Argo: When things are at their worst - call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the USA, which had actually supported his regime for several decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah overboard, because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries.
The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, could not be achieved.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force.
The incarcerated diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their ordeal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian feelings at home.
The debacle in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, directed by the actor Ben Affleck, recounts one episode in this story, which brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was seized, six employees escaped.
After some peripeteia, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in getting them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew, who were surveying locations for a sci-fi blockbuster.
A combination of genres
The plan, conceived by "exfiltration" expert, Tony Mendez, required the assistance of Hollywood.
For the story to be believed, the film project was reported on in specialist magazines, press conferences were organised, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were, for a long time, kept secret; the film draws on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a peculiar mix of genres.
On one hand, there is a realistic incisive political thriller, and at the same time a "caper movie," with small victories and double-crossing - another example would be Ocean's Eleven.
The mood alternates in the film - on one side, sharp documentary-style sequences in Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time, relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, lighter sections from Hollywood, laced with irony and a little exaggeration.
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables, in office corridors, over the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style.
The derided actor has become a respected director, and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third big-screen movie, following his dark crime movie Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
It is also Affleck's first picture, which does not take place in the director's hometown of Boston.
The atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics, which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "featured" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid, creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise, which come flooding in, as history suddenly takes a turn.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes (the fake staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail-biting scenes for the film.
What little there is, is worked well, with some occasional embellishments to reality - these do not all come off so elegantly (the scene, where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America, followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched).
Argo's weakness is its divergence, which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm; their characters deserve more room, and are not by far the only ones in this film.
Affleck's film loses the dramatic pull a little, it is a film, which can be watched with reasonable interest, its production and retro-style are evocative of thrillers from the 70's.
It does not really captivate.
As a reminder of history's particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all-powerful all-controlling secret services, this will do.
Rules for blowing up balloons, for bananas and a circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU."
"We were prompted by the latest story, where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe's largest companies," Patrik Nacher, the poll's organiser, told Pravo.
Among the latest nominated absurdities, for instance, is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women were favoured in life insurance prices, because they constitute a lower risk for insurers.
"Other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year.
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations, we might include the mandatory addition of bio-ingredients to fuel, which consequently harms the environment, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance, or the rules on the size of chicken cages, which significantly raised egg prices this year.
The ban on the use of the term "spreadable butter" and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism.
First rate bananas are to measure 14 centimetres
The Union's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states' interests (just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed).
The lobby's interests were, for example, that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU, and were not to display and "anomalous curvature."
The European Commission defended itself, saying that it was only harmonising existing disjointed national standards, which complicated trading.
Norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU despite opposition from certain states, referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives.
One possible prize-winner in the poll may be the last year's EU regulation according to which inflatable balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision.
Here, the EU pointed to an American research, which indicated that, among other toys, balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blowers.
Strange ideas are conceived at home too
Fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU, who holds an official post, may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece, and instead the acronym FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) should be used.
The Bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association, Laissez Faire, also nominated, aside from the aforementioned absurdities, for example the Union's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state.
The EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions, which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union.
The Czech Republic thereafter exceeded, for instance, the permitted volume of mushroom preserves, which incurred a high penalty.
The poll's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline, or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, however, but from Prague.
"We are handicapped because we do not have the sea.
We are asking the European Union for a refund," declared the minister for agriculture, back in autumn 2004, Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals, and due to the so-called buy-out interventions, the state's warehouses were full and were forced to export.
The Czech Republic is further away from a port, so according to Palas the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros.
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development's minister, Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre legislation is the exception
Regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states, but the EU's efforts at regulation, more effective operation, and development of the entire Union deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more important issue, according to experts, is the drawing of EU funds on projects, which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration, but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting.
Emotions flare among Czechs when, just as other countries in the Union, the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products, in which it does not always succeed.
The Czechs fought for six years with the Germans and Austrians to protect the labelling of their Olomoucke tvaruzky, however the tuzemsky rum, whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here, had to be renamed tuzemak by the manufacturers.
The appellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar, and not sugar beet.
Carlsbad wafers, Pohorelicky and Trebonsky carp, and Zatec hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU, alongside the world-renowned feta cheese and gorgonzola, German marzipan from Lubeck, and Parma ham.
The EU's stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on Pardubice gingerbread and Horicky tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does a person decide they want to run for President?
This is not about me being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, then I would not be running for any post.
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years, thieves roaming about there and people's taxes and retirement age increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I do not like, though, I try to find a solution to change things.
Since I have already turned forty, and I am an independent non-party man, I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president.
You have already reached the Senate, but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle.
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate's elections.
Later, I added that if I were elected as senator, I would be standing for president.
My goal, though, is not the post, the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence, and the strongest mandate possible.
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television, but that we trample anyone, who wants to try to change things.
The Media add to this, misleading the public, and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was allegedly bribing reporters, or I was allegedly an advisor of Jiri Paroubek.
Let's talk about your vision.
You set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics, and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million.
You need to change the law for this.
As president, though, you do not have this power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How are you going to solve this?
When I lobbied, as a citizen, for tour guide work to be a free trade, it was successfully carried through.
The problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right, it will be deliberately rejected, causing delays for the public.
As an independent non-party man, I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides.
The advantage I hold is that without the political pigeonholing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side, and apply it.
Do you see yourself as a person from the right, or the left?
From the Czech viewpoint, it seems they tend to put me to the left.
For me, it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right.
The important part for me is moving forward.
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right, I just want to bring people together.
I always support any good public solutions, even if they are put forward by the KSCM or the ODS, and, in the same way, I will oppose bad ideas.
You get angry when someone calls you a populist.
Are you not confirming this with what you have stated?
When you make a company business plan, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
You try to come close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere, or they have been put forward by experts.
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogans.
You will not last long in politics with that.
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them, that you will succeed, say, in passing criminal and material responsibility?
I have no alternative.
I need to convince politicians, reporters, and the public, and try to get them on my side, so we can put this through.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast, where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges, and the Attorney General.
And, as the case may be, they would need to explain why they did not want this.
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues, it just needs some pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, it was achieved thanks to public pressure.
I will say frankly that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision.
I have just started out in politics, and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda.
I will try to make things progress, but it if does not work out, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is trying to save the Czech Republic.
I am no saviour.
I know that alone I will not achieve anything, so I have asked acquaintances, whether they would run for the senate.
I went to Radim Jancura, who declined due to his workload.
So I, at least, support investigative journalist, Jana Lorencova, who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil.
I put myself forward, because people are really discontented, but now I have my doubts.
Sixty percent of people did not go to vote, and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment.
In the senate, there are only two independents, including me.
People have voted for a senate that will make it difficult to enforce changes.
Nonetheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents.
Are you considering having your own party?
I have not considered it yet, because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background, nor the money to do it.
I have no money even for a presidential campaign, my transparent account holds just 20 thousand.
You have no money?
You are talking about financial disclosures, but what is yours like?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million.
In Prague, I have land worth around 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, an artwork collection worth around ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, a Skoda Superb worth a million, and I have a few million in my account.
I have the Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy.
You drive an Aston Martin, have assets worth 60 million, but you have no money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you are not keen on putting your own money into it.
This does not inspire much confidence.
I do not have 15 million for a campaign.
Should I take out a loan?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme.
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign.
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a senator.
However, I would not be able to live on it, for instance, I could not pay for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I were only interested in making money, I would not be standing for election.
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living?
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold?
This depends on the rate of pay.
As I promised, my activities have been partially reduced.
For example, my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan, who saves the Republic.
But I must also live off something.
As a businessman, what would you usually make monthly?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I still do.
And if I became president, then I would end my business activity.

The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg (literally "book mountain") - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at," said Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the road-side.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a major firm based nearby commented: "It's definitely a thing of beauty, the building."
However, I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and eBooks.
No-one goes into one of these old-style libraries voluntarily nowadays, or am I wrong?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam, which barely merits a visit, is a special record-holder.
The 80,000-resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this asinine situation, the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty, painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam-based architectural firm MVRDV, master of audacious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings, took the project on with his customary composure, and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And with the judging panel still looking at him with bewilderment, shrugging their shoulders, the impertinent Maas stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed up with action - with the words: "Dear Municipality!"
So this is my suggestion for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain - for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain has been lifted up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses, with a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012" competition.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant, has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture.
First and foremost, however, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long journey to the book
The first impression: the Eldorado of books beneath a cheese dome.
There is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif, however, the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot.
The interior space, glazed throughout, is bright and open, the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square.
The urban ambiance is perfect.
You are already on the lookout for a park bench, a dog, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
"Normally book shelves run along the facade, and in the centre there is a large, dark space, which is usually unpleasant and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the centre there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and the central technical support room.
One particularly special feature are the black book shelves, which simultaneously act as wall cladding, parapets and railings for the stairway.
The appearance, feel and scent are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials.
"Here we wanted to work with recyclable materials," explained Joop Trouborst, Project Manager for the Municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the Standard.
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture, on a Frisian farm.
For many years, millimetre-thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer.
It is inexpensive and saves time.
The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste.
For the library, the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-centimetre-thick boards.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouw plastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous and robust material, that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature Café, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
These provide atmosphere, but most importantly, regulate the air humidity in the literary mountain range.
Donations for the new soul
"You would hardly believe it, but this building, in spite of the many glass panels, is a showcase project in the area of ecology," said Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled using geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg has a glass cover, the sun only shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days.
The broad, laminated wood glue beams positioned at right-angles to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight.
The indoor temperature is very pleasant.
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, initially a sceptic of the IT sector, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has also visited already.
So too has TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul."
The reason: At the inauguration just a few weeks ago, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his/her personal collection.
This was, for the time being, to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items.
The concept has been a success.
The shelves are full to capacity.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," said architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain bond with this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
As such, MVRDV have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
However young and uneducated it may be.
This is ultimately a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
In the vote on the incorporation of Palestine, Germany abstained from voting.
According to Stephen Szabo, Expert in US-European relations, in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians' application for observer status within the United Nations.
However, Berlin subsequently abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be cautious.
At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany likewise abstained from voting, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was ultimately implemented by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs?
Yes, it does.
That is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy, indeed moving away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the USA, in favour of a German foreign policy.
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy.
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, yet this is something that they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role, but they are en route to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of France, or Great Britain.
So what specifically does a "normal" foreign policy entail, from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters, which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, that is, by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East, and particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore it must be careful not to affront the public, but also the elite in the Arabic countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
However, I wouldn't want to ascribe too much weight to this. This is not an entirely one-sided relationship.
Nonetheless, it does play an important role in Germany's considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA, by abstaining to vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the USA, a great understanding for the German position prevails.
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya.
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect.
After all, it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on the other hand, have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations?
Due to the American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that secretly, the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu's policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position.
This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position.
This is, of course, no simple task for Germany, on account of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role.
If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, various anti-German feelings become apparent.
This does not make matters simple for the Germans.
This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this stance, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing, yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum, so who is filling the gap?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
However, what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China, however, one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies.
Nonetheless, it is enjoying protection, provided the actual creators of the names do not sue.
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights.
"It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, lawyer within the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specialises in copyright infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
All the copycats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands.
Thus Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny is registered in place of Prada.
German companies are also 'legally' copied in this manner, such as manufacturer of sporting apparel, Puma.
Pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Zegna DF Puma there, an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well-known.
In the major cities there are multi-level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases, however, are slightly different: on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office, fully officially, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This refers to women who latch onto rich men.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing.
"This harms business and we must fight against it," challenges Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to information from market research company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing.
However, the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve, and cost a pretty penny.
The process can last for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases, because after a long period of time, the name to which the objection is being raised has become a "market reality."
If the complainant is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on his trademark in China, said Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Even today, the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo-purchaser Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo; the dispute was arbitrated and Geely was forced to change it.
Fashion house Lacoste lost a suit in China against copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing.
The CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment.
In the past year, however, things reportedly "returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow."
Thus the stock of unprocessed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cased were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nonetheless, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office.
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China, the figures are imposing.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China, for the tenth time in succession, is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications, informed the authority.
The same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks, totalling 5.5 million in number.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received.
Put simply, this means that each application costs on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount, as can be seen in the case of the German family business, Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been contesting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts.
However, the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This is something we missed ourselves, as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was proven right, however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day.
You have to pay extremely careful attention.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs can barely be calculated, the company archive even had to look through century-old records in order to provide proof.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six-figure sum in euros" as settlement.
"This shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spilling over, back into Europe.
Particularly if imitators secure unprotected brand names there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This is a business sector that the group had long vacated, yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration.
"You have to pay extremely careful attention," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather foreigners should also register "everything" that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler.
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee.
In actual fact: if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama, they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name, explained Wentzler.
Or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector.
World AIDS day: Stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in the Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted.
The history of a link that overcomes far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First of all, the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's loafers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor, and quickly do just that.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano surge, beguile and haunt.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth, yet wild gestures.
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi Choir are practising a new song.
The fifteen singers, aging from 23 to 69 years old, range from human geneticists to the maintenance man.
"Om'Obani" is by no means a simple piece, with each voice having a different text, and in an extremely foreign language at that: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Helping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world, as according to the estimations of Unaids, the United Nations' programme to battle AIDS.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of these attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can become a sponsor.
This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gogo Centre.
In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or worshipper.
In this region, no-one can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing it.
For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign, 'soft' language, and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.
For an 8,733-kilometre flight away from Heidelberg, in the north west of the Swaziland Kingdom, lies the village of Esitjeni, which relies on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Around 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni you get a small foreshadow of the illness from which all of Swaziland is suffering: according to Unicef, the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world.
Circumcision, which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half, is barely practised by the population.
More than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in you mid-thirties is by no means rare.
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005, the Choir visited the village, but first and foremost, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, there are barely any opportunities, particularly in a poor country.
Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him/her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year.
However, just one year later, the choir established the "Voices for Africa" Association, which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni at an almost professional level.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections.
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma viruses, herpes genitalis and hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies belong among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men that have intercourse with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men.
Among heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and human papilloma viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low; however, around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papilloma viruses are also frequently found in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001, to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2,700 cases.
This is around one tenth fewer than the previous year.
Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, often they cause no pain or any other symptoms, thus remaining undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contraction, however, they do not offer 100% protection.
This is because occasionally, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact.
Therefore, first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
If diagnosed early, the majority of STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany, the money all adds up.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, Chairperson of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured and assertive woman, manages the money from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans have good accommodation, for example with one of their grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old ladies are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them, providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually every day, in their school uniforms.
Anyone who doesn't have anyone left, arrives at the shelter with Khanyisile, a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school,built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organisation, PSI, organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV.
This is nothing to be taken for granted, as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country, the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo subject," said Annette Lennartz, "because it is associated with sexuality."
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
Among other factors, the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle.
Another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, said Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture prescribes otherwise - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-esteem, which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people, who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy, but some grim-faced border soldiers even shed a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their sponsor children.
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map, it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, that's where the light is," say the people there.
And if you make the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, to visit the stomping singers in their rehearsal room, you'll see that the light is there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency, NASA, has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the planet lies closest to the sun, it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine "Science."
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow.
This is thought to be at east 30 centimetres and perhaps up to 20 metres thick.
The water presumably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that impacted with Mercury.
However, no-one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Chief Scientist for the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
That said, the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system.
Unknown to the majority of the Earth's inhabitants, there are probes, telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix, deployed to research the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they transmit images to Earth: small peepholes into the infinite expanse.
This image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This image section from an infrared recording by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are seen as blue dots, while more difficult to identify are the pink-coloured "new-borns" in the star delivery room.
This star-forming region - rather unromantically named W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light years away.
This shimmering glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material, ejected by the star in the process of dying.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years away from the Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also referred to as "The Seven Sisters," can be seen with the bare eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colours really come into their own.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula looks back at the observer like a red eye.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity with the continent resulted in this Nebula acquiring the title 'North America'.
A combination of normal and infrared photography produced the spectacular colouring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: How these occurred is the greatest puzzle in the field of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remnants of a moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures from the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colouring, photographs of spiral galaxies can become genuine works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid stems from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three parts), as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts.
In the Ophiuchus constellation, astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic collision: 400 million light years from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards one another, destined to collide.
This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations may prefer to call it by its nickname, the Southern Catherine Wheel.
The photo taken by the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cepheus constellation.
The nebula, 1,400 light years away, consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust.
This image was put together from the X-ray images captured by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, was pictured for NASA by the Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This star nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This 'star cradle' continually produces new youngsters.
Likewise, this star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the Earth.
In this bright shining galaxy with one small black hole, there exists no dust - only gas.
Researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later.
Since then, the mirrors in optical telescopes have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound.
For a period of 30 years, namely from 1947 until 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown in the image, had a diameter of five metres.
Arizona, USA,is home to the Large Binocular Telescope.
It enables views of space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canarian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to reduce costs.
In spite of this it achieves a diameter of around eleven metres.
The disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method: the telescope is securely clamped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination.
What sets it apart: the high light-gathering capacity.
This - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world's largest reflector telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can listen for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can be of assistance, by making his/her processing capacity available.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is home to the Very Large Telescope, which lives up to its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum.
Likewise to be located at the ESO Observatory in Chile, the European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned.
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, images are not to be expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes at the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were the largest in the world.
They each have two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside the Keck telescopes, can look to the heavens with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of thirty metres.
Here you can marvel at an artist's impression.
However, the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra-solar planets, especially for any that may be inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the Big Bang.
Scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger orbits around the planets much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists can now be certain.
Drink butter on a daily basis - and live to 168 years of age
In Southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young.
In Southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages that can almost be considered biblical.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding streets, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everywhere is green and lush - you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest.
However, this is the deep south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
This is the home of the Caucasian people group, the Talysh, of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and live long lives.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town is bursting with overpowering architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe rarely come here; the journey from Azerbaijan's capital city, Baku, is too arduous.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, as too much of the route is just a single track.
The fabulous wealth, for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank, has not yet arrives here in the province.
Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May due to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world," said Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum of Longevity, most likely the only of its kind in the world.
Here the lives of eight dozen Talysh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented. Fatulayeva points out a black & white photo.
This here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 he fathered another child.
However, the unrivalled star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Muslimov who is said to have lived to 168 years old.
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this.
And given that the longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years of age, Muslimov's claim seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805, here in the region, and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man married three times and had 23 children, and is said to have fathered another daughter at the age of 136.
So did Shirali Muslimov miscalculate his age by a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, researcher on ageing at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia.
"A strikingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sardinia."
Due to lacking documentation, however, there is no scientific proof of age, particularly as there are no birth registers.
Melted butter by the glass, every day
However, the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding Lerik reach a biblical age with striking regularity.
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age.
So why do so many very old people live here in the south?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special Talysh genetics.
In contrast, Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it is due to diet.
However the notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either.
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old she is still comparatively young for the area.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter churn, which she rolls backwards and forwards tirelessly.
Eight people live here under this roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have been grandparents for some time.
There are also two small children running around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, which is served in typical, bulging Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file, beneath her headscarf she conceals long, dark blond plaits, which her son proudly reveals for us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and it has never fallen out or lost its colour.
"I have never used shampoo either," said Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life I have never once bought groceries in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
Things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War.
However, everything became better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the rudder.
The propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady.
Yet the cult that revolved around the father figure for the nation, who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
He held power until 2003 and his son Ilham later took over the helm.
At least there is no deprivation among Azerbaijan's elderly.
Mirzayeva receives 230 Manat (around the same sum in euros) per month as her pension, which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long greying son is right: "The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture."
They live among their extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible, then what is?
The notion of "human rights" is omitted from the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed.
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion.
We must make the transition.
"And making sure it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was aimed at the entire population,however in particular at the Coptic Christians, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all of them, until now hopelessly estranged in a bewildered opposition, are fearful.
They are fearful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
According to Mohamed Mursi, speaking almost apologetically, he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority, "in order to rescue the revolution."
However, Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a Doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
In actual fact, the 234 articles, which have been pushed through by the Islamic-dominated 110-person Constituent Assembly, are in some aspects cause for concern.
As was also the case under previous constitutions, under the draft judicature is justified on the "principles of Islamic law."
Yet what are "principles"?
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the woolly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least suggested by one newly added article: in all issues affecting Sharia law, the Al Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution, which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam.
This can, but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation, which would result in the de facto incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld.
During Mubarak's rule, these courts served to suppress opposition.
Following the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were under military imprisonment.
According to the draft, the state should also protect "the true character of the Egyptian family, and promote its morals and values."
From a legal perspective, this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art and literature.
In plain language, this is nothing other than censorship.
Incidentally, no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women.
Another does prohibit the insult or slander of the prophet Mohamed and his emissaries.
However, what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the formulation stating that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president sufficient, or a joke at the expense of a jurist?
Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft submitted by Mursi to be signed and that, in his own words, will be submitted to Egyptians for referendum "very soon."
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo, in unfamiliar unity, and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect.
"The revolution is back and we are going to be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place candidate in the presidential elections.
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs "on the rubbish tip of history."
Via SMS service Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead "a coup against democracy."
"If he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said member of the opposition Jasser Said.
"We have not yet grown tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," stated the Egyptian media, quoting opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter-demonstration, although acting cautiously they did not choose the Tahrir Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile, outside the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafis took part, shouting out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi: "Cleanse the country!" and protested: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have most likely provoked events verging on civil war.
Quite clearly, this was something that Mursi's followers did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should move forward.
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists' draft.
"The term 'human rights' does not even appear once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutive process, which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when imprisoned or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this he was battered, condemned and imprisoned.
"And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution," he bemoaned in a discussion with "Welt am Sonntag."
The lawyer has resigned himself to Mursi extending his power to all three branches of state government.
These measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President is effectively suspending it," complained Saeda.
Yet without civil society organisations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels abandoned,even by the international community, which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could come back to haunt them.
One demonstrator at the Tahrir warned: "You are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control."
